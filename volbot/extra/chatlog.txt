yes
why'd it crash last time? encoding issues
didn't crash
yep
im kind of keeping a log of our chat
then using it to markovify things
I figured
but it will take awhile to get enough data for it to work well
do you need to escape "/" in regex
ive got the storage limit set to 100,000
so can we officially rename this class "the adventures of michaelberry finn?"
why did that not work
how do we set topic
let's change it to that snazzy title
ah
hold on
2?
4
4
fucking bots
6

why does yours do it twice tstueesi
well conditioned?
tspagetti
now it wont
idk i havent pulled in awhile
reminder: i said 4
good call joecon
1?
2?
I have no idea
i thought it was n
gonna go with n2
(1)
I mean it is guaranteed bc/ it's the largest
Solving a matrix equation should at least be n^2.. if not n^3
dang
no idea
what is this class
pls
michael no
How can due dates be real if imaginary numbers aren't real?
hmm
NSDate().today
I guess due dates *aren't* real then
How can circuits be real if imaginary numbers aren't real?
boom
real
just won't do my homework then
im in
joseph, you should just quit school
go work for cisco
no degrees necessary
what if we need him to tell us what for loops are
....damn
oh yea
hey tstuessi the TOL can be set to an integer like, say, 6 right?
nvm
berry sent out an email about that
set it to 1.e-6
for person in joseph { print(person) }
I'm convinced joecon is multiple people
joseph
if I can run that for loop on him we'll find out
i mean im pretty sure he comes native with a python interpreter, so that should work
how can joecon be real if he's a python program
hmm
import joecon
for attr in dir(joecon):
from joecon import brain
import * from joecon
You wouldn't download knowledge!
lol
haha
rofl
ayyy
lmaoo
joecon.do_homework(mine)
(I dont actually write import statements so that's prolly bad syntax)
how can syntax be real if languages aren't real
how can joecon be real if python isn't real
tstuessi what times will you be attending csaw my friend
oh yea, i forgot to rsvp to the actual even

AT THE SAME TIME 
Your crazy text can't escape the bounds of the UILabel on my iPhone client
joecon ill build in an exception for Unicode error into the command parsing
"I'm gonna do homework" I said
man all I'm doing is trying to find the I Spill My Drink copy pasta
send your absurdly long bullshit messages now
we need the long one again
i can't seem to get the entire thing
kylebshr
2 + 2
4
dammit stuessi and your duplicate code
WTF
gah why does it split it up for me but not for you or kyle
I think I'm missing a unicode something or other
yea
lol
i'm stress testing the bot for unicode
we had some problems earlier
work with arabic

https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/37ekja/imessages_glitch_fix/
Too Many Requests
classic failure to update branches in action
more of a buffer overflow
talking bout volbot vs sucksbot
.....
ayy
lmao
!volbot sunglasses
what?
good idea
joecon you should write that
what the hell is with this arabic
yep
you should implement that
write what? 
the sunglasses thing that caleb just put up
everything
i don't know what should trigger it though
maybe make it a command
"Yahhhhhhh"
maybe a !volbot add response [keyword] <start> [stuff] <end>
wait that follows the sunglasses. well that won't work
that way you can feed in a command that is simple
and possibly add special variables
e.g. !volbot command ... @u@
where @u@ represents a passed username (or string really)
so you could do !volbot slap joecon
and it would do volbot slaps joecon around with a large trout
just a thought
